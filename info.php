            <em>Information about who (me), the mantainer of this service, is. (This whole page is satire.)</em>
            I am acidbox, previously known as stuxvii, pussyslayer69, skibiditoiletsigmaslippers, the guy who made the lord of the rings movies,
            the guy who brought bonzi buddy back to relevance, the guy who made all those siIvagunner mashups, 
            that one guy who got 40 million subscribers on youtube from recording himself getting scared at children's games, 
            the guy who used meteor client to grief your christian minecraft server and replaced the crosses in the churches with upside down Ts,
            the guy who created needy streamer overload, the guy who got cancelled because they confused him with aidscox (guy who gave aids to coxes), 
            the guy who also got cancelled because they confused him with asciibuns (some guy from a discord server who faked autism, did, ocd, age regression, 
            bipolar disorder, diphalia, being a woman, having mammary cancer, ptsd, schizofrenia, anxiety, depression and down's syndrome).
            I'm also the guy who wrote the first version of the BSD, Linux, NT and Darwin kernel. Thank me for your smart fridge even existing.
            I am your father, your mother, your uncle, your aunt, and your seventh grandad. Flintstones.
